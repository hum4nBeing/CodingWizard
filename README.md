# CodingWizad

**CodingWizad** is a web application that supports real-time collaboration, allowing individual users to save files and folders to run code. This project is built using **Next.js**, **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **TypeScript**, **Socket.IO**, **Monaco Editor**, and **JWT** for authentication and tokens.

## Features

### 🔒 User Authentication
- **Secure Login**: Users can sign up and log in using their email ID, with JWT-based authentication ensuring security.
  
### 🖥️ Real-time Collaboration
- **Create and Join Rooms**: Users can create rooms for real-time collaboration and share their room IDs with others to join the same room. Collaboration is facilitated by **Socket.IO** to enable seamless real-time communication.

### 💻 Code File Management
- **Create and Save Files**: Users can create files in 5 different programming languages: JavaScript, C, C++, Python, and Java.
- **Folders Management**: Users can create folders to organize their code files and run the code within them.

### ▶️ Code Execution
